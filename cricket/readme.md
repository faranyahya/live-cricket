## Installation

Live Cricket app is created for trial purpose. Using pusher for live changes on web page.

- Migrate database.
- Login using admin@admin.com and password : admin
- Open localhost:8000/simulate in a separate window to see data being pushed to home.

Note* Could give less time for development due to power outage. Demonstrated the concepts of Listeners in laravel and showed the undertanding about how to push and manipulate data in realtime environment.
